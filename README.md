Physical activity is an essential component of maintaining a healthy lifestyle, and daily step count serves as a convenient and measurable indicator of physical activity. However, external factors such as weather conditions often influence how much we move on a given day. The purpose of this project is to explore the relationship between daily step counts and various weather variables, such as temperature, precipitation, and wind speed. By understanding this relationship, I aim to gain insights into how external conditions affect my activity levels and identify patterns that can help me make informed decisions to stay active regardless of weather conditions.

The data for this project will come from two primary sources. First, I will collect daily step count data from my smartphone or fitness tracker over a period of at least 30 days. This dataset will provide information about my physical activity patterns. Second, weather data, including temperature, humidity, precipitation, and wind speed, will be obtained through the OpenWeatherMap API for my local area. By combining these datasets, I will be able to analyze the correlation between weather conditions and step count, identifying which variables have the most significant impact on my activity levels.

This project has several expected outcomes. I anticipate gaining a clearer understanding of how weather conditions influence my daily activity levels. The visualizations and analysis will help highlight specific weather patterns that encourage or discourage movement. These insights can be used to create actionable strategies for maintaining consistent activity levels, even on days with less favorable weather conditions. Additionally, the findings could serve as a basis for future projects, such as exploring the impact of other factors like mood or sleep on physical activity.
